    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the previous worksheet, we saw how to use Python to compute mathematical results like $\\sin(\\pi)$. This included the use of variables to simplify expressions. All of the code in the previous worksheet shared a major similarity; it was written to be executed from top to bottom within a cell, with each line being run once. However, most of the important tasks that computers are used for involve repeating steps a large number of times. A computer's ability to repeat steps quickly is one of the main things that differentiate them from humans.\n",

    "The first feature of Python we will learn for handling repetitive tasks is the `for` loop.\n",
