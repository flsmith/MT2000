    "Welcome to the Mathematical Computing Using Python workshops. These workshops are designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of solving mathematical problems using the programming language Python. By the end of these workshops, you should have the knowledge necessary to tackle computational projects in your future maths modules.\n",
    "The lecture notes for this workshop are provided as Jupyter Notebooks, which contain executable examples as well as exercises at the end. You should read through the notes and make an attempt at the exercises before attending the sessions - this way you will get the most out of the help available.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the format of the workshop are available TODO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Computation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Computation\" refers to any mathematical process we carry out following a well-defined routine. Much of the mathematics you already know involves computation. For example, in order to calculate the integral\n",
    "$\\int_{0}^1 (3x^3 + x^2 - 2x + 1)dx$\n",
    "we simply follow the \"power rules\" to obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{0}^1 (3x^3 + x^2 - 2x + 1)dx = (\\frac{3}{4}1^4 + \\frac{1}{3}1^3 - 1^2 + 1) - (\\frac{3}{4}0^4 + \\frac{1}{3}0^3 - 0^2 + 0) = \\frac{13}{12}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the function is defined in a more complicated way, we might not know any routine for  systematically computing the integral. For example,\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}$$\n",
    "but to calculate this requires a geometric \"trick\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, computers are very good at computation! At a basic level, computers can only perform simple operations like addition, but they can do them very quickly. Everything computers do is built out of layers of these simple operations. Computational mathematics is about how to define different mathematical processes to a computer so that we can obtain results that would be to difficult to compute by hand. For example, it would take you a long time to compute the mean of a data set with ten thousand entries by hand, but a computer could do so nearly instantly! As computers improve, they are increasingly important in mathematics. Some examples of their use include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applied mathematicians use iterative and other numerical methods to understand systems of differential equations for which we have no analytic solutions.\n",
    "- Statisticians and computer scientists understand large data sets using methods involving too many parameters to work with by hand.\n",
    "- Physicists and sociologists use computational simulation to go beyond what is possible in \"real world\" experiments.\n",
    "- Computational mathematicians have discovered theorems and proof strategies that are too complicated to carry out by hand.\n",
    "- Even traditional mathematicians, whose focus still lies in theorems and formal proofs, use computers to discover patterns and test conjectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of writing down how to solve a problem in simple steps which can be understood by a computer is called *programming* or *coding*. Programming is an extremely useful mathematical skill, as well as being a vital component of many careers. The purpose of this workshop is to give you the foundation in programming that you will need for future modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "The basic instructions that computers understand are limited and difficult to work with directly. Instead, we write programs in a programming language. The programming language is then converted into the basic instructions, although we usually do not need to worry about that step. There are many programming languages, but in this workshop, you will learn Python. Python is widely available, relatively easy to learn and use, and reasonably good for each of the mathematical tasks mentioned above. For this reason, you will use it in many of the modules in your degree going forward. Specialized modules may use other languages, but your skill in Python will transfer over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be running Python inside *Jupyter Notebooks*. These allow for text and code to be mixed together, and you can run all of the examples in these notes if you have opened the notes as Jupyter Notebooks. Guidance on how to access the notes as Notebooks is available on MMS. There are other methods of using Python, which you may encounter in later modules. Notebooks are divided into *cells*, which may contain text or code. The following cell contains a some Python code which just adds together 3 and 4. You can run the cell by selecting it and then clicking the \"Run\" button at the top, or using the shortcut \"Ctrl-Enter\"."
